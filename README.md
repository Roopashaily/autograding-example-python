# Graded Assignment-01: Branches and loops in Python programming

Write a python program in the square.py inside the function for the below problem statement. 

Problem statement: When analyzing data sets, such as data for human heights or for human weights, a common step is to adjust the data. This adjustment can be done by normalizing to values between 0 and 1, or throwing away outliers.

For this program, adjust the values by dividing all values by the largest value. The input begins with an integer indicating the number of floating-point values that follow. Each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point can be achieved as follows:
print(f'{your_value:.2f}')

Output the average of all the normalised values.

Ex: If the input is: 5
30.0
50.0
10.0
100.0
65.0


Return the average from the function. (0.51)
